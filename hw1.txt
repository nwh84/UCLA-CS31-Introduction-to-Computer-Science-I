1. What is the output produced by the following program segment? Don't just run it — trace through it and figure it out by hand (which is a skill you'll need for the exams).
string endline = "endl";
cout << "endl";
cout << endline;
cout << endl;
cout << "endline";
The output would be  “endlendl”, a new line, and then “endline” . 


2. Consider the following program:
The program will output n lines and on each line there will be lens minus line-number (with line-number starting at 1 and increasing with each new line) number of blank spaces plus “#” after the spaces. 


3. Copy the program in problem 2 and change it so that for any input number, the changed program produces exactly the same output as the original, but the changed program uses a while loop instead of a for loop for the inner loop.
#include <iostream>
    using namespace std;


    int main()
    {
        int len;


        cout << "Enter a number: ";
        cin >> len;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++)
        {
            int j=1+i;
            while (j<len)
            {
                cout << " ";
                j++;
            }
            cout << "#" << endl;
        }
            return( 0 );
    }


4. Copy the program you wrote for problem 3 and change it so that for any input number, it produces exactly the same output as the original, but uses a do-while loop instead of a for loop for the outer loop. Be careful! (Hint: How does it behave if len is not positive?) You may need to add a little additional code to make sure the program behaves identically to the program in problem 3.
  #include <iostream>
using namespace std;


int main()
{
    int len;


    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> len;


  for (int i = 0; i < len; i++)
    {
        int j = i;
        do{
            if(j==(len-1)){
                break;}
            cout << " ";
            j++;
        } while (j<len);
        cout << "#" << endl;
    }


5.  Assume weekday has been previously declared as an int and given a meaningful value. Write a switch statement that for any value of weekday, produces exactly the same output as the following if statement.
switch (weekday){
    case 1:
        cout<<"rainy days and mondays get me down";
        break;
    case 2:
        cout<<"ruby tuesday";
        break;
    case 3:
        cout<<"regular day";
        break;
    case 4:
        cout<<"regular day";
        break;
    case 5:
        cout<<"regular day";
        break;
    case 6:
        cout<<"wonderful weekend";
        break;
    case 7:
        cout<<"wonderful weekend";
        break;
}
